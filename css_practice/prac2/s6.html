  One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over
  their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the grey
  smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names were
  Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted
  as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge
  and new discovery.
